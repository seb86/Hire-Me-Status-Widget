== Description ==

Easily display if you are available for hire using this widget. Useful for freelance developers like me.

Note: The team members can be filtered. [See documentation for filters](https://github.com/seb86/Hire-Me-Status-Widget/wiki).

= Contributing and reporting bugs =

You can contribute code to this plugin via GitHub: [https://github.com/seb86/Hire-Me-Status-Widget](https://github.com/seb86/Hire-Me-Status-Widget) and localizations via Transifex: [https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/hire-me-status-widget/](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/hire-me-status-widget/)

= Support =

Use the WordPress.org forums for community support - I cannot offer support directly for free. If you spot a bug, you can of course log it on [Github](https://github.com/seb86/Hire-Me-Status-Widget) instead where I can act upon it more efficiently.

If you want help with customisation, hire me if I am available or hire another developer!

== Installation ==

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don't even need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install, log in to your WordPress admin panel, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type "Hire Me Status Widget" and click Search Plugins. Once you've found the plugin you can view details about it such as the the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by clicking _Install Now_.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application.

* Download the plugin file to your computer and unzip it
* Using an FTP program, or your hosting control panel, upload the unzipped plugin folder to your WordPress installation's `wp-content/plugins/` directory.
